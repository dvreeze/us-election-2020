US-election-2020
================

This Scala project analyzes JSON data of the 2020-11-03 US presidential election.
For the data sets and more background information (and a Python script to expose fraudulous data), see `the-switc`_.

Not being a US citizen myself, why would I worry about the validity of the US presidential elections in 2020?

The thing is: I do not want to accept a tyrannical world in which truth has become meaningless. No matter where you stand
on the political spectrum, these elections were stolen. There is abundance of evidence to everyone paying attention,
and I will not go there (other than analyzing JSON voting data).

Of course the mainstream media prematurely declared a winner of the election, but they lie about everything of importance,
as every sufficiently awake person knows.

The election result data sets mentioned above were fed to the MSM, who used the data to their advantage, as if there are
no anomalies to see in the data. See for example `fraud proven`_. Of course anyone can inspect the same data, and find some
interesting things in there that the MSM failed to report on. Also see `thedonaldwin`_, where you can find a Python script
analyzing the data.

I wanted to have a look myself at the data, partly using code (written in Scala) doing the same as the Python script. Hence
this small project.

Indeed, the data shows massive fraud, and that's just in a JSON data set. Not to mention all other proof there is of the biggest
election fraud in US history.

Anyway, we should never be silent about the truth. Our future depends on it.
